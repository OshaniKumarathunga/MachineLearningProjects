# Machine Learning Projects 

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects **!  
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have developed to learn, practice, and demonstrate various machine learning techniques. Each project focuses on a unique problem and provides a detailed implementation.

## Projects Included

### 1. **Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression**
   - **Objective**: Build a predictive model to classify heart disease based on patient health data.
   - **Dataset**: Contains 1,025 records with 14 features (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).
   - **Highlights**:
     - Data preprocessing and statistical exploration.
     - Logistic Regression model with accuracy:
       - **Training data**: ~85%
       - **Test data**: ~80%
     - Predictive system to classify new patient data.
   - **Folder**: `Heart_Disease_Prediction`

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
